    title: "Why stake in this beautiful meta-staking pool?",
    text: `Several Reasons:<ul>
    <li>You <i>tokenize your stake</i> so now you can use stNEAR in the emerging NEAR DEFI market while you
      keep earning staking rewards. Liberate your stake now!!</li>
    <li>Once you stake here, you can do <i>Liquid Unstakes</i>, meaning you can get your NEAR back without
      waiting several days</li>
    <li>You avoid putting all eggs in one basket. This contract distributes itâ€™s delegated funds into several
      validators, so you greatly reduce the risk of getting no-rewards due to validator outages</li>
    <li>By distributing stake, you contribute to decentralization and censorship-resistance for the NEAR
      protocol</li>`,

  {
    title: "What's stNEAR?",
    text: `<b>stNEAR</b> means staked-NEAR, is the NEP-141 token this contract manages,
    representing your share of the MetaPool stake. After staking, you can use your stNEAR in other markets while
    still earning rewards.
    After each epoch, the stNEAR price will increase as staking-rewards are added to the pool.
    <b>stNEAR</b> price will always increase as long as there are staking rewards.`,
  },
  {
    title: `How does the "Liquid Unstake" works?`,
    text: `Within the contract there's a <i>Liquidity Pool</i>, the pool works like an
    "single-direction swap pool" allowing you to swap <b>stNEAR</b> for NEAR paying a "swap fee".
    The fee increases when there's low liquidity in the pool and decreases when the liquidity is abundant.`,
  },
  {
    title: `Who provides the NEAR for Liquid Unstake?`,
    text: `Anyone can become a liquidity provider for the liquid unstake functionality.
    Liquidity providers get part of the lquid unstake fee and also receive $META governance tokens
    automatically every monday. Check the "Liquidity" section.`,
  },
  {
    title: `What's "Delayed-Unstake"?`,
    text: `In the NEAR blockchain, validators can not remove their stake immediately and
    must wait some period to do so. Waiting periods can be from 2 to 4 days.`,
  },
  {
    title: `Why my staking is not reflected in the "staking" section of my NEAR Wallet?`,
    text: `Good question! The meta-pool staking is reflected in you holding <b>stNEAR tokens</b>,
    it will not be reflected in the wallet as "staking", it will be reflected as <b>stNEAR tokens</b>`,
